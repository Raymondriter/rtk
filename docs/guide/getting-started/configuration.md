# Configuration

## Config file location

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| Linux | `~/.config/rtk/config.toml` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/rtk/config.toml` |

```bash
rtk config            # show current configuration
rtk config --create   # create config file with defaults
```

## Full config structure

```toml
[tracking]
enabled = true              # enable/disable token tracking
history_days = 90           # retention in days (auto-cleanup)
database_path = "/custom/path/history.db"   # optional override

[display]
colors = true               # colored output
emoji = true                # use emojis in output
max_width = 120             # maximum output width

[filters]
# These apply to file-reading commands (ls, find, grep, cat/rtk read).
# Paths matching these patterns are excluded from output, keeping noise low.
ignore_dirs = [".git", "node_modules", "target", "__pycache__", ".venv", "vendor"]
ignore_files = ["*.lock", "*.min.js", "*.min.css"]

[tee]
enabled = true              # save raw output on failure
mode = "failures"           # "failures" (default), "always", "never"
max_files = 20              # rotation: keep last N files
# directory = "/custom/tee/path"  # optional override

[telemetry]
enabled = true              # anonymous daily ping — see Telemetry & Privacy for full details

[hooks]
exclude_commands = []       # commands to never auto-rewrite

[awareness]
level = "default"           # "default", "high", "full" — see Awareness level
```

For full details on what is collected, opt-out options, and GDPR rights, see [Telemetry & Privacy](../resources/telemetry.md).

## Awareness level

`rtk init` writes a short instructions file for the agent (`~/.claude/RTK.md`, `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`, …).
`awareness.level` controls how much that file says about RTK:

| Level | Content | Use when |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `default` | Output contract only: output is condensed, treat it as complete, `rtk proxy <cmd>` if unusable. The agent never learns RTK exists. | Agents with a command hook (default). |
| `high` | `default` + what RTK is and its meta commands (`rtk gain`, `rtk proxy`, `RTK_DISABLED=1`, `rtk discover`). | You want the agent to be able to explain or bypass RTK. |
| `full` | `high` + "prefix every shell command with `rtk`". | Agents without a hook, or when you want the agent to drive rtk itself. |

Agents without a command hook (Codex CLI, Cline, Windsurf, Kilo Code, Antigravity, Kimi) always
receive `full`, whatever the configured level: without the prefix rule RTK would never run for them.
`rtk init` prints a note when it does this.

After changing the level, re-run `rtk init -g` (or the agent-specific `rtk init --agent <name>`)
to rewrite the file.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `RTK_DISABLED=1` | Disable RTK for a single command (`RTK_DISABLED=1 git status`) |
| `RTK_TEE_DIR` | Override the tee directory |
| `RTK_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` | Disable telemetry |
| `RTK_HOOK_AUDIT=1` | Enable hook audit logging |
| `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1` | Skip env validation (useful with Next.js) |

## Tee system

When a command fails, RTK saves the full raw output to a local file and prints the path:

```
FAILED: 2/15 tests
[full output: ~/.local/share/rtk/tee/1707753600_cargo_test.log]
```

Your AI assistant can then read the file if it needs more detail, without re-running the command.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `tee.enabled` | `true` | Enable/disable |
| `tee.mode` | `"failures"` | `"failures"`, `"always"`, `"never"` |
| `tee.max_files` | `20` | Rotation: keep last N files |
| Min size | 500 bytes | Outputs shorter than this are not saved |
| Max file size | 1 MB | Truncated above this |

## Excluding commands from auto-rewrite

Prevent specific commands from being rewritten by the hook:

```toml
[hooks]
exclude_commands = ["git rebase", "git cherry-pick", "docker exec"]
```

Patterns match against the full command after stripping env prefixes (`sudo`, `VAR=val`), so `"psql"` excludes both `psql -h localhost` and `PGPASSWORD=x psql -h localhost`.

Subcommand patterns work too: `"git push"` excludes `git push origin main` but not `git status`.

Patterns starting with `^` are treated as regex:

```toml
[hooks]
exclude_commands = ["^curl", "^wget", "git rebase"]
```

Invalid regex patterns fall back to prefix matching.

Or for a single invocation:

```bash
RTK_DISABLED=1 git rebase main
```

## Telemetry

RTK sends one anonymous ping per day (23h interval). No personal data, no file paths, no command content.

Data sent: device hash, version, OS, architecture, command count/24h, top commands, savings %.

To opt out:

```bash
# Via environment variable
export RTK_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1

# Via config.toml
[telemetry]
enabled = false
```

## Custom filters

Add your own filters (or override built-ins) in either location:

- **Project-local** — `.rtk/filters.toml` in your project root (committed with the repo)
- **User-global** — `~/.config/rtk/filters.toml` (applies to every project)

See [`src/filters/README.md`](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk/blob/master/src/filters/README.md) for the full TOML DSL reference.

### Trusting custom filters

Because a filter can rewrite what your AI assistant sees, custom filter files are **not applied until you trust them**. An untrusted (or edited) filter file is skipped silently on the command path. You review and manage trust with explicit commands:

```bash
rtk trust      # shows each filter and asks to confirm (--yes to skip the prompt)
rtk untrust    # revokes trust
```

`rtk init` also detects existing filters and lets you enable them — interactively, or non-interactively with `--trust-filters` / `--no-trust-filters`. Trust is tied to the file's contents (SHA-256), so editing a trusted file requires re-running `rtk trust`.

> **Upgrading:** earlier versions applied `~/.config/rtk/filters.toml` without trust. After upgrading, the user-global file is gated like project filters — if you already relied on a global filter, run `rtk trust` once to re-enable it.
