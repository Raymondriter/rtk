# Configuration

## Config file location

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| Linux | `~/.config/rtk/config.toml` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/rtk/config.toml` |

```bash
rtk config            # show current configuration
rtk config --create   # create config file with defaults
```

## Full config structure

```toml
[tracking]
enabled = true              # enable/disable token tracking
history_days = 90           # retention in days (auto-cleanup)
database_path = "/custom/path/history.db"   # optional override

[display]
colors = true               # colored output
emoji = true                # use emojis in output
max_width = 120             # maximum output width

[filters]
# These apply to file-reading commands (ls, find, grep, cat/rtk read).
# Paths matching these patterns are excluded from output, keeping noise low.
ignore_dirs = [".git", "node_modules", "target", "__pycache__", ".venv", "vendor"]
ignore_files = ["*.lock", "*.min.js", "*.min.css"]

[retriever]
mode = "sqlite"             # sqlite (default) | tee (legacy files) | disabled
max_entry_bytes = 10485760  # sqlite: 10 MiB per entry
max_entries = 200           # sqlite: FIFO cap
retention_days = 30         # sqlite: 0 disables age eviction
compression = true          # sqlite: gzip blobs (lossless)
# database_path = "/custom/recall.db"
tee_max_files = 20          # tee mode: rotation
tee_max_file_size = 1048576 # tee mode: per-file cap
# tee_directory = "/custom/tee/dir"

[telemetry]
enabled = true              # anonymous daily ping — see Telemetry & Privacy for full details

[hooks]
exclude_commands = []       # commands to never auto-rewrite
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `RTK_DISABLED=1` | Disable RTK for a single command (`RTK_DISABLED=1 git status`) |
| `RTK_RECALL=0` | Disable the recall store for a single command |
| `RTK_RECALL_DB` | Override the recall database path |
| `RTK_TEE=0` | Legacy alias of `RTK_RECALL=0` (still honored) |
| `RTK_TEE_DIR` | Override the tee directory (tee mode) |
| `RTK_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` | Disable telemetry |
| `RTK_HOOK_AUDIT=1` | Enable hook audit logging |
| `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1` | Skip env validation (useful with Next.js) |

## Recall system

When a command fails — or a filter trims a long list — RTK persists the full output to an embedded database and prints a recall hint:

```
FAILED: 2/15 tests
[full output: rtk recall 36365b69eda6]
```

Your AI assistant runs `rtk recall <hash>` exactly as printed in the hint — that is the whole agent interface. For humans inspecting the store: `rtk recall <hash> --full | --from N | --lines N | --grep PAT` and `rtk recall --list`. Storage is byte-faithful (`BLOB` + lossless gzip); the stored input is the captured command text, as with the previous tee files.

### Choosing the recovery mode

The simplest way is the CLI — no file editing needed:

```bash
rtk config recall           # show the active mode and its source
rtk config recall sqlite    # hash-addressed sqlite store (default)
rtk config recall tee       # legacy .log files in ~/.local/share/rtk/tee/
rtk config recall disabled  # no recovery storage
```

Setting a mode rewrites only the relevant keys in `config.toml` (comments and other sections are preserved), and migrates a legacy `[tee]` section — its `max_files`/`max_file_size`/`directory` values are carried over. The equivalent config field, if you prefer editing the file directly, is `[retriever] mode = "sqlite" | "tee" | "disabled"` (see the full structure above).

To see how often your assistant actually goes back for elided output — and which filter caps deserve tuning — see [`rtk gain --recalls`](../analytics/gain.md#recall-efficiency).

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `retriever.mode` | `"sqlite"` | `sqlite` (default), `tee` (legacy files), `disabled` |
| `retriever.max_entry_bytes` | `10485760` | Per-entry storage cap (10 MiB) |
| `retriever.max_entries` | `200` | FIFO cap on retained entries |
| `retriever.retention_days` | `30` | Age eviction in days (0 = off) |
| `retriever.compression` | `true` | gzip stored blobs (lossless) |
| Max file size | 1 MB | Truncated above this |

## Excluding commands from auto-rewrite

Prevent specific commands from being rewritten by the hook:

```toml
[hooks]
exclude_commands = ["git rebase", "git cherry-pick", "docker exec"]
```

Patterns match against the full command after stripping env prefixes (`sudo`, `VAR=val`), so `"psql"` excludes both `psql -h localhost` and `PGPASSWORD=x psql -h localhost`.

Subcommand patterns work too: `"git push"` excludes `git push origin main` but not `git status`.

Patterns starting with `^` are treated as regex:

```toml
[hooks]
exclude_commands = ["^curl", "^wget", "git rebase"]
```

Invalid regex patterns fall back to prefix matching.

Or for a single invocation:

```bash
RTK_DISABLED=1 git rebase main
```

## Telemetry

RTK sends one anonymous ping per day (23h interval). No personal data, no file paths, no command content.

Data sent: device hash, version, OS, architecture, command count/24h, top commands, savings %.

To opt out:

```bash
# Via environment variable
export RTK_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1

# Via config.toml
[telemetry]
enabled = false
```

## Custom filters

Add your own filters (or override built-ins) in either location:

- **Project-local** — `.rtk/filters.toml` in your project root (committed with the repo)
- **User-global** — `~/.config/rtk/filters.toml` (applies to every project)

See [`src/filters/README.md`](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk/blob/master/src/filters/README.md) for the full TOML DSL reference.

### Trusting custom filters

Because a filter can rewrite what your AI assistant sees, custom filter files are **not applied until you trust them**. An untrusted (or edited) filter file is skipped silently on the command path. You review and manage trust with explicit commands:

```bash
rtk trust      # shows each filter and asks to confirm (--yes to skip the prompt)
rtk untrust    # revokes trust
```

`rtk init` also detects existing filters and lets you enable them — interactively, or non-interactively with `--trust-filters` / `--no-trust-filters`. Trust is tied to the file's contents (SHA-256), so editing a trusted file requires re-running `rtk trust`.

> **Upgrading:** earlier versions applied `~/.config/rtk/filters.toml` without trust. After upgrading, the user-global file is gated like project filters — if you already relied on a global filter, run `rtk trust` once to re-enable it.
